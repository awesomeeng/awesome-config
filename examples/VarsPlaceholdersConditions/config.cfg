// An example config that uses variables, placeholders and conditions

// First we define a general object with some placeholders in it.

one: {
	"one": 11,
	"two": 12,
	"three": "<<This gets filled in later>>",
	"four": "${env:AWESOMECONFIG_TEST}"
}

// Now we add a condition predicated on an environment variable.
// Depending on that env var, we replace one.three with one.one or
// one.two.

[env:AWESOMECONFIG_TEST==one]
one.three: ${one.one}

[env:AWESOMECONFIG_TEST==two]
one.three: ${one.two}
